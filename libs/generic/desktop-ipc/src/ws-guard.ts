/**
 * WebSocket guard — the FOURTH and last transport door (no-http-anywhere P-013).
 *
 * `installDesktopIpcPolyfills` routes `fetch` and `EventSource` over IPC, and
 * P-010 closed `XMLHttpRequest` with a guard. `WebSocket` is what is left: the
 * egress monitor WRAPS the constructor, but only to RECORD (`via:'websocket'`),
 * and a recorder cannot refuse anything.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE WRITING THIS (2026-08-03), because this plan's
 * standing rule is to re-measure a premise rather than inherit it — D-006, D-008,
 * D-037, D-038 and D-040 were each refuted or re-shaped on contact:
 *
 *  - **No WebSocket endpoint shares the LOCAL operator's HTTP listener.** Not one
 *    `upgradeWebSocket` route exists on the local Hono host, and every
 *    `WebSocketServer` it can reach binds its OWN dedicated port (`{ port }`) —
 *    `desktop-voice-ws` (3076), `pty-ws` (3056), `device-voice-ws`, `frame-vnc`.
 *    So for the desktop webview this guard protects, a same-origin `/api`
 *    WebSocket is not merely absent, it is unserved: there is nothing on the other
 *    end for a shim to reach.
 *
 *    ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-08-30 (EI-21855861879191381) — READ THIS BEFORE REUSING THE
 *    BULLET ABOVE AS A PREMISE. It used to end: "There is no `noServer:true` and no
 *    `{ server }` attachment ANYWHERE, so no socket shares the operator's HTTP
 *    listener." That word is now false. `apps/operator/bin/hosted-handler.ts` — the
 *    HOSTED (app.papercusp.com) runtime, which did not exist when this was measured
 *    on 2026-08-03 — builds `new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` and serves
 *    `/api/hosted/connectors/socket` from an `upgrade()` hook on the SAME handler
 *    that mounts `/api/*` and the SPA. It is ticket-authenticated (`?ticket=ht_…`)
 *    and carries BOTH the reverse connector and the browser side of a hosted
 *    workspace session; `apps/operator/app/cloud-workspaces/HostedWorkspaceSession
 *    .tsx` opens it at `window.location.origin`.
 *
 *    THE GUARD'S DECISION BELOW STILL STANDS, and the scope is exactly why: that
 *    socket lives in a DIFFERENT RUNTIME from the desktop webview, which talks to
 *    its own local host, so nothing the desktop can reach has changed. What HAS
 *    changed is that the browser portal — where `installDesktopIpcPolyfills` never
 *    runs, so none of this file executes — now has a real same-origin WebSocket
 *    and no guard on it at all. Classifying that is the portal transport
 *    inventory's job, not this file's to route.
 *
 *    `packages/operator-core/lib/doc-claims/same-listener-websocket-sites.test.ts`
 *    now PINS the corrected claim against the real tree, so the NEXT same-listener
 *    attachment fails a test instead of silently rotting this paragraph the way the
 *    original did. That the first one went unnoticed is the actual defect here: a
 *    guard kept passing while the measurement justifying it quietly expired.
 *  - **All four client call sites target a different LISTENER.** voice x2 and
 *    video default to `ws://127.0.0.1:3076/api/desktop/voice` — a separate
 *    sidecar port, under the one prefix D-008 sanctions for the native transport.
 *    PiPanel's PTY *socket* resolves to `null` in the Tauri shell, so it never
 *    opens one: the panel takes the native path (`isTauriNative()` →
 *    openNativeSession → Tauri IPC → pty.rs) instead. ⚠ Say "socket", not
 *    "PiPanel returns null" — dropping that word is how this sentence was
 *    misread into WI-7546 ("PTY is disabled in the desktop"), which is refuted.
 *    Note the operative null is the `:3055` port check, NOT the
 *    `__PAPERCUSP_TAURI__.kind === 'native'` branch this comment used to cite:
 *    measured live 2026-08-03, that global was absent in the desktop webview
 *    while `isTauriNative()` was still true. None of them addresses the IPC
 *    channel either way.
 *  - **Those consumers are P-014's, not P-013's** — that item is literally "PTY
 *    (terminals) and voice onto the shim". By the plan's own decomposition the
 *    shim has no consumers until P-014 runs.
 *
 * So this file is P-013's guard branch, deliberately and not by default — the
 * same shape P-010 took and D-040 blessed. Building `IpcWebSocket` + a Rust
 * `endpoint_data` command + an operator-side DATA receiver TODAY would be a
 * four-piece, two-language transport with zero consumers AND zero endpoints, and
 * its close/backpressure/binary semantics could only be guessed at until a real
 * socket exercises them. D-041 already put the principle on the record: a frame's
 * first consumer is what proves it works. The DATA frame keeps its first consumer
 * — it is P-014's, where the requirements actually live. See D-042.
 *
 * WHY IT REUSES `isRequireIpc()`. Same reason as `xhr-guard`: `requireIpc` ALREADY
 * is this policy ("never silently fall back to the webview's HTTP transport"), so
 * a fourth transport with its own switch is exactly the drift `desktop-bootstrap`
 * routes both `/api` branches through one helper to prevent. One policy, four
 * transports; `forceHttp` still disarms all of them. And a `process.env` lever
 * could not work here anyway — Vite compiles `process.env` to `{}` in the shipped
 * bundle, so every such flag reads `undefined` in the exact webview this protects
 * (D-040(b), EI-19420043903144442).
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT RECORD INTO THE EGRESS MONITOR — and here the ordering makes it
 * free. The monitor wraps `WebSocket` during the pre-`expectsIpc` block; this
 * guard wraps on top of that wrapper. So a REFUSED socket throws before the
 * recorder is ever reached and is never counted, while an ALLOWED one falls
 * through to it and is counted exactly once. That is precisely D-040(c)'s
 * requirement (a blocked call escaped nothing, and false positives red a
 * release-gate-BLOCKING invariant) satisfied by construction rather than by a
 * second bookkeeping path.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT REUSE `wrapConstructor` FROM egress-monitor.ts. It swallows any
 * exception its hook throws — deliberately, and correctly, for a recorder ("a
 * missed record is a reporting gap; a thrown constructor is an outage"). A guard
 * whose whole job is to throw cannot be built on a wrapper that eats throws.
