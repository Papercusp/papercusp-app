/**
 * Classifying WHY an IPC invoke failed — the distinction `requireIpc` depends on.
 *
 * Two very different conditions used to be collapsed into one predicate
 * (`isIpcUnavailable`), which was fine while the answer was always "fall back to
 * HTTP". Once `requireIpc` made the answer "wait forever instead", collapsing
 * them became a hazard: waiting is right for a bridge that is *coming up*, and
 * catastrophic for a bridge that is *never coming up*.
 *
 *  - **not-ready** (`invoke_failed:…`, `state not managed`): the bridge is coming
 *    up. Either the Rust `IpcClientHandle` answered but has no live socket to
 *    dial *right now* (the operator is still booting, or its advertisement is
 *    momentarily stale mid-restart), or the handle is not `.manage()`d YET —
 *    in prod it is registered only after the operator is reachable, so
 *    "state not managed" is a startup window, NOT a permanent condition.
 *    Waiting genuinely resolves both.
 *
 *  - **not-wired** (`ipc_disabled`, `access control`, `ipc://`): there is no
 *    bridge in this webview and nothing will create one. Either the shell was
 *    launched with the Rust kill switch `PAPERCUSP_DESKTOP_IPC=0`, or the webview
 *    itself rejects `ipc://` invokes at the fetch layer before they reach Rust.
 *
 * Why this matters concretely: `PAPERCUSP_DESKTOP_IPC=0` is a deliberate operator
 * rollback lever. Under a single collapsed predicate + `requireIpc`, pulling that
 * lever would make every stream hang forever instead of falling back — i.e. the
 * rollback lever would break the app at exactly the moment someone reached for it
 * to un-break it. A not-wired bridge is treated as equivalent to `forceHttp`:
 * the operator has chosen HTTP, so use HTTP.
 *
 * ⚠ The disabled case is signalled EXPLICITLY (the Rust side registers a handle
 * that answers `ipc_disabled: …`) rather than inferred from `state not managed`.
 * Inferring it is wrong and was tried first: `state not managed` is ALSO the
 * prod pre-handshake window, so treating it as permanent silently reintroduces
 * WI-6257 — every boot-era stream falls back and holds one of the webview's ~6
 * sockets for the whole session. Intent must be stated, not guessed.
 */

 * The bridge is absent by construction — not coming up later. Callers must fall
 * back to HTTP even when `requireIpc` is on.

 *
 * `invoke_failed` by itself is deliberately NOT enough. It also wraps failures
 * from `IpcClient::invoke` while writing a request to an existing socket; at
 * that point delivery is ambiguous and replaying a POST could duplicate an
 * already-applied mutation. These three details are emitted earlier:
 *
 *  - `state not managed` — Tauri never entered the Rust command;
 *  - `no endpoint-ipc socket available` — the reconnecting handle resolved no
 *    live advertisement and never constructed an `IpcClient`;
 *  - `endpoint-ipc connect:` — opening the socket failed before `invoke()`.
 *
 * This narrow predicate is the safe retry boundary for one-shot fetches. The
 * broader {@link isIpcNotReady} remains appropriate for idempotent streams.
