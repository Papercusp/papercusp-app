/**
 * `IpcEventSource` — drop-in replacement for the global `EventSource`
 * that dispatches over Tauri IPC instead of opening a webview HTTP
 * connection.
 *
 * Install pattern (desktop bootstrap, next phase): on Tauri,
 * `window.EventSource = IpcEventSource`. Every consumer that does
 * `new EventSource('/api/...')` — including `createResilientEventSource`
 * (which reads `globalThis.EventSource`) — transparently moves to IPC.
 *
 * Spec semantics preserved:
 *  - `readyState`: 0=CONNECTING, 1=OPEN, 2=CLOSED.
 *  - `open` fires when the upstream response is 200 + text/event-stream.
 *  - Any other status / content-type fires `error` and closes (terminal).
 *  - `message` is the default event type; named `event:` lines dispatch
 *    as a `MessageEvent` of that type.
 *  - `id:` updates a persistent `lastEventId`; on reconnect we forward
 *    it as a `Last-Event-ID` header so resumable streams (sync SSE,
 *    log streams) keep their ring-buffer replay semantics.
 *
 * `withCredentials` is accepted for API compatibility but has no
 * effect — IPC has no cookies; the bridge's trust model synthesizes
 * the operator principal.
