/**
 * XMLHttpRequest guard — the third transport door (no-http-anywhere P-010).
 *
 * `installDesktopIpcPolyfills` patches `fetch` and `EventSource`. It has never
 * patched `XMLHttpRequest`, so an XHR to `/api/*` inside the desktop shell goes
 * straight to the network stack — the exact egress D-005 forbids ("HTTP is a
 * loud failure, never a fallback").
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE WRITING THIS (2026-08-03), because the plan's own
 * rule is to re-measure a premise rather than inherit it (D-006/D-008/D-037/
 * D-038 were each refuted on contact):
 *
 *  - The premise HOLDS. In two live shells (`:3055` and `:3270`),
 *    `String(XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open)` is still native code while
 *    `window.fetch` is patched — XHR is genuinely unguarded.
 *  - But NOTHING currently reaches `/api` through it. Zero XHR call sites exist
 *    in our own source. Five bundle chunks reference `XMLHttpRequest`, all
 *    third-party and none able to target `/api`: two Emscripten loaders (sync
 *    GET for their own `.wasm`), Prism's `data-src` highlighter, vditor (its
 *    upload path is the only `/api`-shaped one and `upload` is not configured
 *    at our single `new Vditor(...)` call site, so it is unreachable), and
 *    posthog-js (whose `api_host` resolves to `https://flags.papercuspai.com`,
 *    a foreign origin — the OTHER axis, not this one).
 *  - Live confirmation, with its limit stated: both shells reported
 *    `initiatorType === 'xmlhttprequest'` COUNT ZERO. That zero is bounded —
 *    both buffers sat at exactly 250 entries, the resource-timing cap, so it
 *    covers the retained window rather than all history.
 *
 * So this file is P-010's second branch ("prove nothing reaches /api via XHR and
 * add a guard that throws if anything ever does"), not its first. Routing XHR
 * over IPC was rejected: it would build a whole XHR→IPC adapter for zero
 * consumers, and the static audit above is a SNAPSHOT that expires the next time
 * someone adds a dependency. A guard is the part that does not expire.
 *
 * WHY THIS REUSES `isRequireIpc()` INSTEAD OF ADDING A DEV-MODE FLAG. P-010 asks
 * for a "dev-mode guard", but a new knob would be both redundant and unreachable:
 *
 *  1. `requireIpc` ALREADY is this policy — "never silently fall back to the
 *     webview's HTTP transport", default ON. `ipcFetchWithFallback` throws under
 *     it. Giving XHR its own switch is exactly the drift `desktop-bootstrap.ts`
 *     guards against when it routes both `/api` branches through one helper "so
 *     the requireIpc rules cannot drift apart between them". One policy, three
 *     transports.
 *  2. A `process.env`-based dev flag could not work here anyway. In the shipped
 *     Vite bundle `process.env` is compiled to the literal `{}`, so every env
 *     lever in `config.ts` reads `undefined` — measured 2026-08-03 against
 *     `dist/assets/configure-*.js`, where `DESKTOP_IPC_FORCE_HTTP`,
 *     `DESKTOP_IPC_REQUIRE` and three siblings all appear as `{}.NAME`. A guard
 *     keyed to `NODE_ENV` would therefore be inert in precisely the webview it
 *     exists to protect.
 *
 * Net: the guard is armed wherever `requireIpc` is armed, and the existing
 * `forceHttp` lever disables it along with the rest of the polyfill block — the
 * documented rollback path, not a second one.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT RECORD INTO THE EGRESS MONITOR. Tempting, and wrong in both
 * directions. When the guard THROWS, nothing reaches the network — recording it
 * would be a false positive in a signal that D-009 makes a release-gate-BLOCKING
 * invariant, and false reds are the expensive direction there. When the guard
 * only warns, the request does go out and resource timing records it by itself —
 * recording again would double-count. The monitor stays the single source of
 * truth for what actually escaped; this file only decides whether the call is
 * allowed to happen and names who made it.
 *
 * WHAT IT ADDS THAT RESOURCE TIMING CANNOT. Attribution and timing. A resource
 * entry says `/api/x` was fetched, never by whom; throwing at `.open()` puts the
 * offending call site on the stack. And an entry only appears once a request
 * COMPLETES, so an XHR that hangs is invisible to the monitor forever — this
 * sees it at open().
