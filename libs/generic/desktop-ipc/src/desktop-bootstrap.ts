/**
 * `installDesktopIpcPolyfills` — Tauri-only install of `IpcEventSource`
 * (as `window.EventSource`) and an `ipcFetch` wrapper (as `window.fetch`
 * for same-origin /api/* requests).
 *
 * After install, every existing consumer that does
 * `new EventSource('/api/...')` or `fetch('/api/...')` — including
 * `createResilientEventSource`, which reads `globalThis.EventSource` —
 * transparently rides the IPC bridge instead of opening a webview HTTP
 * connection. That removes the webview's HTTP-pool-per-host pressure
 * entirely (the connection-pool bug that hangs the live agent-thinking
 * popover on the harness page).
 *
 * Scope:
 *  - Only runs in the Tauri webview (`__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` present).
 *  - Skipped when the host's force-HTTP escape hatch is set (see
 *    `configureDesktopIpc` / `DESKTOP_IPC_FORCE_HTTP`) — same kill-switch
 *    the tool transport picker honors.
 *  - `fetch` wrapper: same-origin /api/* → ipcFetch; everything else
 *    (cross-origin PostHog/LLM/asset traffic, same-origin non-/api/*)
 *    falls through to the native fetch unchanged.
 *  - `EventSource` install is unconditional once we decide to install
 *    at all. Current consumers are all same-origin /api/*; a future
 *    cross-origin EventSource consumer would surface a `bad_path` error
 *    from the bridge and we'd add a routing wrapper at that point.
 *  - Idempotent: a second call returns null without re-patching.

 *    libsoup's 6-socket pool. So in dev this branch means the ADVERTISEMENT
 *    is missing/stale (no file for the selected port, dead pid, or vanished
 *    socket) — not "dev has no IPC". Check that file before concluding the
 *    transport is unavailable.
 *    ⚠ Do NOT restore the older claim that dev "never `.manage()`s an
 *    IpcClient / errors with 'state not managed'" — that predates the
 *    reconnecting dev handle and sent at least one investigation (2026-07-26)

 *  - **prod startup window** — between webview mount and the sidecar's
 *    `PAPERCUSP_IPC_READY` handshake (up to 30s), the client isn't
 *    connected yet.
 *
 * Under `requireIpc`, `ipcFetch` keeps the narrow, proven-pre-dispatch form
 * pending and retries until the caller aborts or the reconnecting handle finds
 * the new advertisement. Legacy/rollback mode falls back to HTTP. Ambiguous
 * write failures and `upstream_error` / `aborted` mean IPC may have run, so

 * via a module-level `active` handle, and `PerformanceObserver` is a real global in
 * Node — so without this line the first test to run captures the monitor and every
 * later test's freshly-built `window` never receives `__papercusp_egress__`, since
 * the installer returns the stale handle before it can attach. That reads as "the
 * detector does not install", which is indistinguishable from the wiring bug these
 * tests exist to catch. A reset that clears only part of a module's state is a trap
 * for whoever writes the next test.
