/**
 * Webview HTTP egress monitor.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: inside the desktop shell, an `/api/*` call must travel over
 * IPC. Any `/api/*` request that reaches the real network stack is a bug — the
 * webview has no usable network stack, and a silent HTTP fallback is what let
 * the same defect survive three times (no-http-anywhere-2026-07-28 D-005:
 * "HTTP is a loud failure, never a fallback").
 *
 * WHY RESOURCE TIMING IS THE RIGHT SENSOR, and not a fetch counter: a request
 * the IPC polyfill handled never touches the network stack, so it produces NO
 * `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry at all. The converse is therefore exact —
 * **an `/api/*` entry in resource timing IS the egress bug**, with no need to
 * instrument, wrap, or trust the transport that is itself under suspicion. It
 * also observes requests made by code that never went through our polyfill
 * (a third-party script, a stray `<img>`, an XHR — P-010), which a fetch-level
 * counter cannot see by construction.
 *
 * WHY `buffered: true` IS LOAD-BEARING: the offenders measured on 2026-07-28
 * all fire at t=480-783 ms — BEFORE the polyfill installs (P-011). A monitor
 * that only saw entries after its own installation would report a clean zero
 * and miss every one of them. `buffered: true` replays the entries already in
 * the performance buffer, so installation order stops mattering.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE 2026-07-28 PROBES MEASURED, AND WHY THIS FILE CHANGED (WI-6657)
 *
 * The perf suite read `performance.getEntriesByType('resource').length === 0`
 * in 483 of 483 polls of the packaged app — including 86 polls where the SPA
 * was demonstrably mounted. Two INDEPENDENT blindnesses stacked to produce it,
 * and only the first was ever suspected:
 *
 *  1. WebKitGTK does not record custom-scheme loads. Measured directly against
 *     WebKitGTK 2.52.3 with the scheme registered exactly as wry 0.55.1 does
 *     (`register_uri_scheme` + `register_uri_scheme_as_secure`): a document at
 *     `papercusp://localhost` gets NO resource-timing entry for its own
 *     `papercusp://` html/js/css, nor for `blob:` or `data:`. So a mounted SPA
 *     legitimately shows zero entries. That zero was TRUTHFUL, not blind:
 *     http fetch (CORS-ok, CORS-REJECTED and `mode:'no-cors'`), XHR, `<img>`
 *     and `sendBeacon` ARE all recorded from that same document. An escape is
 *     visible; the sensor's mechanism is sound.
 *
 *  2. ...but THIS FILE then threw every one of them away. The old code defaulted
 *     `origin` to `window.location.origin` and skipped any entry whose origin
 *     differed. In the packaged shell that document origin is
 *     `papercusp://localhost`, whose `new URL(...).origin` is the string
 *     `"null"` — so it matches nothing, and 100% of real escapes were filtered
 *     out before the `/api/` rule ever ran. In the dev shell the origin is
 *     `http://127.0.0.1:3270`, matches, and the 9 known escapes were found.
 *     The sensor worked in exactly the one shell we do not ship.
 *
 * The fix is the rule below: "our origin" is only a meaningful filter when the
 * document HAS an http origin. When the document is served over a custom
 * scheme, every http(s)/ws(s) request is by construction leaving the app's
 * intended transport, so none of them may be filtered by origin.
 *
 * WHAT RESOURCE TIMING STILL CANNOT SEE — measured, not assumed: WebSocket and
 * EventSource produce NO entry at all (the probe's server confirmed both
 * connections were established while the buffer stayed empty). Desktop sync is
 * SSE-primary, so resource timing alone is blind to the app's main data
 * transport. `installEgressMonitor` therefore also wraps those two
 * constructors — the only way to see them — and folds what they report into the
 * same rule.
 *
 * WHY THE VERDICT IS THREE-VALUED: zero escapes and a broken sensor produce the
 * same number. A negative claim ("nothing escaped") is only worth anything from
 * a sensor proven live, so `verdict` is `clean` ONLY after `verifyEgressSensor`
 * has watched a deliberate control request land in the buffer; otherwise it is
 * `unknown`, which every caller must treat as a BREACH. A POSITIVE observation
 * needs no such proof — seeing an escape is evidence in itself — so `breach`
 * never depends on the control.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTROL IS NOT RUN IN THE SHIPPED APP: the probes established that no
 * zero-egress control exists (`blob:`, `data:` and custom-scheme fetches are all
 * invisible), so proving the sensor live costs one real HTTP request. Making the
 * shipped app emit one would violate the very invariant it is auditing. CI and
 * the e2e suite call `verifyEgressSensor` and get a real verdict; the shipped
 * app reports `unknown` and is honest about it.
 */

/**
 * How an escape was observed. Resource timing cannot see the last three.
 *
 * `csp-violation` is the P-006 cross-check: the browser's own CSP engine
 * reporting a request that the local-only policy would have blocked. Its blind
 * spots are DIFFERENT from resource timing's, which is the whole point of having
 * it — it can see a request refused before it ever reached the network stack
 * (and therefore produced no timing entry at all), while resource timing sees
 * requests that no policy covers. Agreement between them is corroboration;

/**
 * WHICH INVARIANT an observation violates. Two ORTHOGONAL rules ride the one
 * sensor (egress-monitor-origin-axis-2026-08-02 P-001/P-002):
 *
 * `ipc-escape`    — an `/api/*` call on OUR origin reached the network stack
 *                   instead of travelling over IPC (the original transport
 *                   invariant, no-http-anywhere D-005).
 * `foreign-origin`— a request went to a host we do not own, whatever its path
 *                   (the DESTINATION invariant).
 *
 * They are reported SEPARATELY and must stay that way. They have different
 * owners and different fixes: an ipc-escape is a bug in our transport layer, a
 * foreign-origin is usually a third-party library's baked-in CDN default.
 * Collapsing them into one number destroys the only signal that makes either
 * actionable.
 *
 * WHY THE SECOND AXIS EXISTS. The original rule filtered to `/api/` paths on the
 * document origin, so it was STRUCTURALLY blind to the entire public-CDN class:
 * `https://unpkg.com/vditor@3.11.2/dist/js/lute/lute.min.js` was discarded in the
 * dev shell for not being our origin, and in the packaged shell for not being an
 * `/api/` path. Six such fetches (vditor, monaco, plantuml, porcupine, excalidraw,
 * emoji-mart) shipped for months under a live, healthy, correctly-working monitor
 * — because it was answering a different question.
