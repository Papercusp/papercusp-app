/**
 * Host seam for `@papercusp/desktop-ipc`.
 *
 * The transport picker (`index.ts`) and the polyfill installer
 * (`desktop-bootstrap.ts`) both honor a "force HTTP" rollback escape
 * hatch — a way to flip every IPC call back to HTTP without shipping a
 * new Rust binary. To keep this package free of any consuming-app
 * branding, the host decides how that flag is resolved:
 *
 *   import { configureDesktopIpc } from '@papercusp/desktop-ipc';
 *   configureDesktopIpc({
 *     forceHttp: () => myEnv.FORCE_HTTP === '1',
 *   });
 *
 * When left unconfigured, it falls back to the generic, unbranded
 * `DESKTOP_IPC_FORCE_HTTP` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_IPC_FORCE_HTTP`) lever, so
 * a no-wiring escape hatch still exists for plain consumers.
 *
 * That lever is read from `globalThis.__DESKTOP_IPC_ENV__` FIRST and
 * `process.env` second — see {@link readEnvLever}. In a browser bundle only the
 * first works: `process.env` is substituted by the bundler at build time, so a
 * `process.env`-only hatch is silently inert in the shipped app, which is
 * exactly how this one was dead for the whole no-HTTP rollout
 * (EI-19420043903144442).

   * Observed live 2026-07-28 (WI-6512, owner-reported): the operator was
   * LISTENING on its IPC socket with **zero** connections to it, while the
   * webview held 6 TCP connections carrying 5 long-lived SSE streams — i.e. the
   * fix was installed, connected to nothing, and had reverted to the exact
   * libsoup 6-socket exhaustion it exists to prevent, with no signal anywhere.
   * The owner's symptom was "clicking an agent takes several seconds".
   *
   * With `requireIpc` on:
   *  - **Streams** never construct a native EventSource. An unavailable bridge
   *    stays RETRYABLE forever (the `ipc-wait` path), so a stream waits for the
   *    bridge instead of burning one of ~6 per-host sockets for the session.
   *    This is strictly better than falling back: the stream connects the moment
   *    the bridge is up, and boot is unaffected.
   *  - **Fetch** keeps a proven PRE-DISPATCH "not ready yet" request pending
   *    and retries until its AbortSignal fires or IPC reconnects. This is safe
   *    even for POST: no request frame crossed the bridge. Ambiguous failures
   *    after dispatch still reject loudly instead of replaying over HTTP, so a
   *    broken bridge remains visible rather than becoming a slow degradation.
   *
   * `forceHttp` still overrides this — it stays the deliberate rollback lever.

 * Rust-side defect, now fixed (WI-6512).
 *
 * The defect, for context, because it is the reason this constant exists:
 * `discovery_pid_alive` decided whether an endpoint-ipc advertisement was live
 * by grepping the process cmdline for `serve.mjs`/`serve.ts` — but the process
 * that writes the advertisement and owns the socket is the hono host. Measured
 * 9 of 9 live operators failing that check, so `/api` classified every
 * advertisement as a restart orphan and never dialed. The JS fallback here was
 * MASKING that: it quietly moved every stream onto the webview's ~6-socket
 * libsoup pool, where five long-lived SSE streams starve everything else. The
 * owner's symptom was "clicking an agent takes several seconds"; nothing
 * anywhere reported an error.
 *
 * The success criterion for this flip, VERIFIED LIVE on 2026-07-28 rather than
 * assumed — in a Tauri shell against the release operator on :3070:
 *  - six concurrent `EventSource`s all reached `readyState: 1` and held it for
 *    the full 10s sample (before the fix: a single stream sat at readyState 0
 *    for 12s and never opened);
 *  - the WebKit network process held **2** TCP connections before opening
 *    those six streams, **2** while all six were live, and **2** after — i.e.
 *    the streams consumed no sockets, because they were on IPC.
 *
 * Why default ON rather than leaving the fallback as a safety net: the fallback
 * is not a safety net, it is a silence. It degrades the app instead of failing
 * it, so a broken transport presents as "feels slow" and survives for months.
 * With `requireIpc`, a stream that cannot reach the bridge stays CONNECTING and
 * retries forever (the bridge comes up and it connects), and `ipcFetch` rejects
 * loudly. `forceHttp` remains the deliberate rollback lever.
