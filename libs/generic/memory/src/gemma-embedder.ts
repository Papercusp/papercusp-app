/**
 * EmbeddingGemma-300m local embedder. Adopted as the default local embedder
 * on the 2026-07-10 owner ask; superseded as the SOLE default by harrier
 * (WI-4082, 2026-07-11) but kept live as harrier's hybrid companion — both
 * are warmed by the embed-sidecar at boot and both stay bundled by owner
 * directive (WI-5638, 2026-07-20). A sibling of BGE-small's `buildLocalEmbedder`
 * (local-embedder-worker.ts); shares the same worker-thread isolation via
 * `embedViaWorker`, differing in three ways EmbeddingGemma requires:
 *
 * 1. MODEL — `onnx-community/embeddinggemma-300m-ONNX` (Transformers.js/ONNX
 *    build of Google's EmbeddingGemma-300m, Sept 2025; MTEB-Multilingual-v2 #1
 *    among <500M-param models).
 *
 * 2. DIMENSION — EmbeddingGemma is natively 768-dim with Matryoshka (MRL)
 *    representation. ⚠ MRL nesting is TRAINED AT SPECIFIC TARGET DIMS, and per
 *    google/embeddinggemma-300m's model card the officially supported ones are
 *    768, 512, 256 and 128 — **384 is NOT among them**. So do NOT read this as
 *    "any prefix is a valid lower-dim embedding": an intermediate prefix is an
 *    UNTRAINED cut.
 *
 *    ⚠ WE RUN AT THE NATIVE 768 AND TRUNCATE NOTHING. This file previously
 *    truncated to 384 to fit the then-existing `vector(384)` columns, and said
 *    so here at length. That cut is GONE (D-005, migration 727 widened every
 *    prose column to 768) — it was an untrained intermediate prefix and it
 *    MEASURED badly: prose retrieval MRR @384 .2889 vs @512 .3435 and @768
 *    .3492, with the paired bootstrap excluding zero for both
 *    (@768 +.0603, CI [.0210,.1022]) — D-003, plan
 *    `prose-embedding-384-untrained-mrl-fix-2026-08-02`, which measured this
 *    rather than assuming either way. Published curve for reference
 *    (MTEB Multilingual v2, Mean(Task)):
 *      768 -> 61.15 | 512 -> 60.71 | 256 -> 59.68 | 128 -> 58.23   (384: unmeasured)
 *
 *    The fix was to REMOVE the truncation, not relocate it to a trained point:
 *    at `targetDims === nativeDims` the untrained-cut bug class is structurally
 *    impossible rather than one config typo away, and it costs no extra compute
 *    (the model always runs a native-768 forward pass; MRL is only a slice
 *    afterwards). See `EMBEDDER_DIM_SPECS.gemma` in ./embedder-dims, which is
 *    the single place the width is declared.
 *
 *    `mrlTruncate` is still on the write path and still load-bearing: at 768
 *    its slice is an identity, but it performs the L2 renormalization. The
 *    correct MRL procedure is truncate-THEN-normalize, so we ask the pipeline
 *    for an UN-normalized vector (`normalize: false`) and normalize ourselves.
 *
 *    If you are ever changing this target: a width change is a multi-hour,
 *    all-at-once migration (~395k vectors; pgvector cannot cast between
 *    widths), and any narrower value must be a TRAINED dim (512/256) — never
 *    another intermediate prefix. The original docblock's claim that 384 was a
 *    supported MRL dim is exactly what licensed the cut unexamined
 *    (EI-19301722864393687).
 *
 * 3. TASK PROMPTS — EmbeddingGemma is an asymmetric dual-encoder trained with
 *    task prefixes. Documents and queries get DIFFERENT prompts, and the two
 *    are designed to be cross-comparable, so storage uses the document prompt
 *    and search queries use the query prompt (`gemmaPrompt`). Passing the wrong
 *    prompt still lands in the same space (same model) — only slightly
 *    suboptimal — so this is a quality knob, never a correctness footgun.
 *
 * SPACE: EmbeddingGemma vectors are a DISTINCT embedding space from BGE and
 * OpenAI (the embedding-space-vs-dimension scar / EI-8913) — and the scar is
 * SHARPER now, not milder: gemma and openai are both 768-wide, so a shared
 * dimension is emphatically not a shared space and their cosines remain
 * incomparable. They live in their own `memory_vec_gemma` table
 * (migration 534), selected by `ResolvedEmbedder.mode === 'gemma'`.
