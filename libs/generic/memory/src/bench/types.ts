 * Memory-backend benchmark — neutral types.

 * (memory-backend-benchmark-2026-06-05 D-001): the same corpus is seeded
 * into every backend under test, the same frozen gold set is replayed,
 * and the same write-round-trip checks run — no backend-specific paths.
 * A `NoopBackend` run is the control: any check a no-op "passes"
 * measures nothing.
 *
 * Everything here is host-agnostic. The corpus/gold-set CONTENT and the
 * live wiring (credentials, PG schema, cost pricing) belong to the host
 * (the operator keeps them in packages/operator-core/lib/memory/bench).
