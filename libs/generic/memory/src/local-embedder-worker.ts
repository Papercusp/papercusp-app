/**
 * Worker-thread isolated local embedder.
 *
 * The @huggingface/transformers BGE-small pipeline runs ONNX inference
 * that can take 100-500ms per embedding on a modest CPU. Running it on
 * the Node.js main event loop blocks every concurrent request during
 * that window. This module wraps the pipeline in a `worker_threads`
 * Worker so embedding work happens off the main thread.
 *
 * Step B1 of Tier-3 follow-up arc.
 *
 * Architecture: one persistent worker per process (lazy-spawned on first
 * embed call). The worker holds the warm pipeline; main-thread requests
 * marshall {id, text} → worker via `postMessage`, await on a pending
 * Promise keyed by id, and resolve when {id, vector} comes back.
 *
 * Falls back to inline (main-thread) embedding if worker_threads can't
 * be loaded — keeps behavior backward-compatible.

 * `libs/generic/rerank/src/local-reranker-worker.ts` — this module is the one
 * that was copied from). An always-ref'd worker keeps a one-shot script alive
 * forever, which is the bug the original `unref()` below fixed. But an
 * always-UNREF'd worker is worse in a way that is *silent*: while the caller
 * awaits its vector, neither the unref'd worker nor the awaited Promise counts
 * as loop work, so a host with nothing else ref'd is considered IDLE
 * **mid-request**. `beforeExit` then fires, the hook terminates the worker, and
 * because `_resetWorker` used to CLEAR `state.pending` rather than reject it, the
 * caller's promise never settled at all — the process just exited 0 having
 * produced neither a vector nor an error.
 *
 * So the whole worker-thread mechanism silently did not apply on any host whose
 * loop is otherwise empty: every CLI, bench, migration driver and one-off
 * script. The operator was never affected, because an HTTP server's loop is
 * never idle — i.e. it failed only where nobody watches and worked everywhere
 * anybody looks, which is how it survived this long.
 *
 * The window is the whole model load, not just inference: the worker script
 * posts `{kind:'ready'}` as soon as its message handler is installed, BEFORE
 * building any pipeline. Measured 2026-08-10: a standalone script awaiting one
 * `embedViaWorker` was stranded 3/3, with `beforeExit` observing
 * `pendingCount: 1`; the byte-identical script with a `setInterval` holding the
 * loop ref'd returned a 384-dim vector in 683ms.
 *
 * Ref'ing only while `state.pending` is non-empty satisfies both: a script that
 * awaits an embedding stays alive until its vector arrives, then exits on its
 * own.

 * pool (loadavg 2000-3000 host stutter, WI-3792). That incident was fixed with
 * a hardcoded `intraOpNumThreads: 4`, which capped the big host and left the
 * SMALL host unfixed: 4 is an ABSOLUTE constant, so it never scaled DOWN.
 *
 * EI-20493854163389792: the packaged 0.0.16 desktop on a fresh 8-vCPU Ubuntu
 * guest measured 415.2% average process CPU (360/418/422/465/411 over 5×1s)
 * while the first-run UI sat idle — ≈4 saturated intra-op threads plus main.
 * `/api/health/deep` simultaneously reported loopLag pressure=ok, which is the
 * tell: the burn is on NATIVE ORT threads, not the JS event loop. First run is
 * the worst case because the whole seeded corpus is unembedded, so the
 * embed-backfill sweep keeps the pool hot; and the packaged default runs the
 * embedder IN-PROCESS (the embed sidecar is opt-in via PAPERCUSP_EMBED_SIDECAR),
 * which is why the cost lands on the operator's own PID. On that guest the
 * hardcoded 4 is HALF the machine — a first-run user watching an idle screen
 * sees the app peg their CPU.
 *
 * So the cap is now a SHARE, not a constant: at most `MAX_INTRA_OP_THREADS`,
 * and never more than 1/`BACKGROUND_HOST_SHARE_DIVISOR` of the host, floor 1.
 *   1-7 cores → 1  ·  8 → 2  ·  16+ → 4 (WI-3792's ceiling, unchanged)
 * Mirrored in local-embedder-worker.script.mjs (plain-JS worker, can't import
