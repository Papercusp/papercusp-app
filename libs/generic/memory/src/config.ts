// ESM loader resolves the symlink inconsistently — some import sites get
// the symlink path, others the realpath — so a module-level singleton
// FORKS into two instances: `configureMemory()` (called by the operator's
// lib/memory/configure.ts) sets `_host` on one, while the store's own
// `await import('./mem0-connection')` reads `memoryHost()` from the other
// → "@papercusp/memory is not configured" and memory is dead at runtime.

// realpath, which is why this only bit the ESM/tsx path, not CJS.)
