/**
 * The neutral `MemoryBackend` seam — the swap point for the persistent
 * memory store (generalize-memory-backend-swappable-2026-06-05, D-001).
 *
 * Deliberately a SMALL, store-agnostic surface: no mem0 vocabulary
 * (`user_id`, pgvector, vec tables, collections), no operator coupling.
 * A backend maps the neutral concepts onto its own store:
 *
 *   - `scope` — an opaque string naming a memory pool. The operator uses
 *     `<user-id>`, `harness:<slug>`, and the legacy `workspace:<id>`;
 *     the backend treats it as a partition key (mem0 maps it to its
 *     `user_id` filter; a file backend might map it to a directory).
 *   - `kind` — an optional caller-defined tag (`identity` / `preference`
 *     / `project` / `correction` in the operator). Backends without a
 *     first-class column store it in `metadata.kind`.
 *   - `text` — the fact body. Backends may transform on write (mem0's
 *     LLM fact-extraction can split one input into several entries, or
 *     decide nothing is memorable), which is why `remember` returns
 *     0..N ids.
 *
 * Capability methods (`rememberConversation`, `invalidate`) are OPTIONAL
 * — mem0-grade features a plain store shouldn't be forced to fake.
 * Callers feature-test (`backend.rememberConversation?.(…)`).
 *
 * Availability: `available()` is the non-throwing probe. Every other
 * method throws `MemoryUnavailableError` when the store is unreachable
 * or deliberately disabled — "unavailable" is NOT the same as "empty",
 * and silently dropping a write would lie to the caller.
 */

/**
 * What SCALE a `MemoryEntry.score` is expressed on.
 *
 * `score` has always been documented as "backend-native; ordering only", which
 * is correct and is precisely the problem: ordering-only values from DIFFERENT
 * backends land in the SAME telemetry column, and nothing downstream could tell
 * them apart. Making the scale machine-readable is what lets a reader refuse to
 * compare across scales instead of silently averaging them.
 *
 * The scales are not merely differently-calibrated — they answer different
 * questions, which is why no linear rescaling can reconcile them:
 *
 * - `cosine`  — a SIMILARITY. Absolute and comparable across calls: 0.9 means
 *               "very close to the query" no matter which call produced it. A
 *               bad query yields low numbers, so the score can reveal it.
 * - `rrf`     — a RANK, reciprocal-rank-fused: `Σ lexWeight/(k + rank)` over the
 *               legs an entry appears in. Bounded above by `(1+lexWeight)/(k+1)`
 *               (0.0328 at the k=60/lexWeight=1 defaults) and comparable ONLY
 *               within one call. Critically it is NOT a relevance measure at
 *               all: SOMETHING is always rank 1, so a meaningless query scores
 *               the same as a perfect one. An rrf score can never reveal a bad
 *               query — see context-injection-audit-2026-07-28 D-011.
 * - `lexical` — a backend-native token/keyword overlap from the embed-free
 *               fallback leg (WI-4214). Ordering only; typically small rational
 *               fractions.
 * - `unknown` — the backend declined to say. Treated as its own bucket and
 *               NEVER pooled with a labelled one.

/**
 * WHICH RETRIEVAL LEG(S) produced an entry, and at what rank within each.
 *
 * A fused `score` is a SUM over legs (see `ScoreScale.rrf`), and a sum is not
 * invertible: 1/(k+3) from cosine alone and 1/(k+7)+1/(k+9) from both legs are
 * different numbers with no way back to the legs that made them. So the moment
 * `fuse()` writes the fused score, the answer to "which leg found this?" is
 * gone — for every downstream reader, permanently.
 *
 * That matters because the two legs FAIL DIFFERENTLY and are fixed differently:
 * a cosine miss is a query/embedding problem, a lexical miss is a tokenization
 * or identifier problem. Telemetry that records only the fused score can report
 * a healthy-looking recall while one leg has been contributing nothing at all —
 * which is exactly what a live measurement found (see the `minLexScore` note in
 * `hybrid-fusion.ts`: a 1526-memory pool whose cosine candidates shared ZERO ids
 * with its lexical rows, for 336 of 337 consecutive recalls).
 *
 * Ranks are 1-based and LEG-LOCAL — a rank is only comparable within its own
 * leg and its own call. `undefined` means the entry was absent from that leg,
 * which is a real observation and not a zero.
 *
 * ⚠ This is a per-CALL retrieval fact, deliberately NOT `metadata`. `metadata`
 * is backend-passthrough state belonging to the STORED fact; a rank belongs to
 * the query that just ran. Putting it there invites a writer to persist it, and
 * a persisted rank is wrong the instant any other query runs.

   *    the question was retrieved ONLY by a query naming its literal id. The
   *    identifiers were not merely wasted there — they were DILUTING.

   * ⚠ KEEP IT SHORT. `canonical-store.lexicalSearch` normalizes its score by
   * `tokens × 3`, so every token added to THIS string lowers the normalized

   * exactly that number. Genuine exact-identifier matches already span 0.33–0.96

 * P-001, re-scoped by D-020). The original P-001 read the bug as "the floor is
 * lost inside the backend". It is not: the floor works, and F-B/D-010 fixed the
 * push path by selecting `cosine-gated` per call. Fusion semantics are genuinely
 * CALLER-SPECIFIC — dedup and classification callers want unfloored
 * nearest-neighbour behaviour on purpose, and the PULL path legitimately admits
 * a strong identifier match with weak cosine (measured: a healthy 29.2% zero-hit
 * rate there, versus the push path's 0.0% before the fix). So per-call mode
 * selection is the correct design, not a bypass to close.
 *
 * What was genuinely left is that **the permissive mode is what you get by
 * omission**: `floored-union` admits lexical-only hits on `minLexScore` ALONE,
 * independently of the cosine floor, so a push-like caller added tomorrow could
 * set `minScore` believing it had bought precision and silently get none. That
 * is the same class as the founding bug — a 0.45 floor running at 0.03 for
 * months because nothing asserted it — and it is a DEFAULTS problem, not a
 * fusion-algorithm problem.
 *
 * The fix makes the unsafe combination INEXPRESSIBLE rather than merely
 * discouraged: pass a floor and you must state the fusion mode. Note the shape
 * deliberately permits `minScore: number | undefined` alongside an explicit
 * `fusionMode` — an env-tunable floor that resolves to undefined is still a
 * caller who has thought about fusion, which is the whole property being
 * enforced.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here: flipping the default to `cosine-gated` and making
 * the pull path opt in. That was D-020's other candidate, and it silently
 * changes retrieval for the eight existing callers that take the default — a
 * relevance change this plan's method rule (D-041) says must be measured per
 * caller against the live corpus, not assumed. This change alters no behaviour
