/**
 * Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B local embedder (prose-embedding-384-untrained-mrl-fix
 * P-003) — a BAKE-OFF CANDIDATE, not a default: adoption is gated on a prose
 * gold-set win outside noise, judged against gemma@512/@768 per that plan's
 * D-003. A sibling of `buildGemmaEmbedder` sharing the same worker-thread
 * isolation via `embedViaWorker`, differing in three ways Qwen3 requires:
 *
 * 1. MODEL — `onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX`, natively 1024-dim,
 *    with MRL supporting user-defined widths across 32..1024.
 *
 * 2. POOLING — **LAST TOKEN**, not mean and not CLS. Qwen3-Embedding is a
 *    decoder; its sentence representation is the final position's hidden state
 *    (the official `last_token_pool`). ⚠ Unlike harrier — which is also a
 *    last-token Qwen3-family model — this export does NOT bake pooling into
 *    the graph: its outputs are `last_hidden_state` plus the KV cache, with no
 *    `sentence_embedding`. So harrier's `output` trick does not transfer, and
 *    the pooling genuinely has to happen on the JS side.
 *
 *    THE POOLING IS ONLY CORRECT BECAUSE WE EMBED ONE TEXT PER CALL.
 *    transformers.js implements `last_token` as the final sequence position
 *    with no attention-mask check; over a single text nothing is padded, so
 *    that position is the last real token. See the batching warning in
 *    local-embedder-worker.script.mjs before ever batching this.
 *
 *    The last real token is the tokenizer's appended `<|endoftext|>` (verified:
 *    "hello world" tokenizes to [14990, 1879, 151643]) — which is exactly the
 *    representation Qwen3-Embedding is trained to pool, not an off-by-one.
 *
 * 3. PROMPTS — **asymmetric**: queries carry an instruct prefix, documents are
 *    embedded RAW. Taken verbatim from the model's own
 *    `config_sentence_transformers.json`, including the detail that there is NO
 *    space after `Query:` (matching the card's `get_detailed_instruct` helper).
 *    Scoring Qwen3 with one symmetric prompt understates it and voids the
 *    comparison — the same trap the eval CLI's docblock flags for gemma.
 *
 * SPACE: Qwen3 vectors are a DISTINCT embedding space from gemma/granite/BGE
 * (the embedding-space-vs-dimension scar / EI-8913) — a shared width is NOT a
 * shared space, and adoption means a full re-embed.
