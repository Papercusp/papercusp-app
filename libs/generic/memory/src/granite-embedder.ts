/**
 * IBM Granite-Embedding-R2 local embedders (prose-embedding-384-untrained-mrl-fix
 * P-003) — BAKE-OFF CANDIDATES, not defaults: adoption is gated on a prose
 * gold-set win outside noise, judged against gemma@512/@768 per that plan's
 * D-003. Siblings of `buildGemmaEmbedder`, sharing the same worker-thread
 * isolation via `embedViaWorker`, differing in three ways granite requires:
 *
 * 1. MODELS — two sizes, and they are NOT interchangeable in width:
 *      97m  → 384-dim NATIVELY (no truncation happens at all)
 *      311m → 768-dim, with TRAINED Matryoshka nesting at 768/512/384/256/128
 *
 * 2. POOLING — **CLS**, not mean. Verified from each model's
 *    `1_Pooling/config.json` (`pooling_mode_cls_token: true`, every other mode
 *    false), not from a summary of the card. This is the single most important
 *    line in this file: pooling a CLS-trained model with `mean` returns a
 *    perfectly plausible vector from the wrong space, so the bake-off would
 *    read a measurement bug as a fair loss for granite.
 *
 * 3. PROMPTS — **symmetric**: no task prefix on either side. Verified from
 *    `config_sentence_transformers.json`, which declares BOTH prompts as the
 *    empty string (`{"query": "", "document": ""}`). Contrast gemma and Qwen3,
 *    which are asymmetric dual-encoders and are understated without their
 *    prefixes. Do not "helpfully" add one here.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO ARE THE INTERESTING CANDIDATES — AND WHY IT IS NOT "THEIR 384
 * IS TRAINED". The prose surfaces store `vector(384)`, and the incumbent
 * gemma@384 measured a real 19-21% MRR loss against gemma@512/@768 on the
 * prose gold set (that plan's D-003).
 *
 * ⚠ That loss is ORDINARY WIDTH LOSS, not a penalty for cutting at an
 * untrained point. D-003 measured it directly and corrected the plan's
 * original hypothesis: gemma@384 lands ABOVE the trained 512/256
 * interpolation (.2889 vs .2718), and the TRAINED 256 is dramatically WORSE
 * than the untrained 384 (-.0889 MRR). **Trainedness did not predict quality
 * in either direction.** So do not read these candidates as "correct because
 * their 384 is trained" — that reasoning, applied consistently, selects 256
 * and measurably degrades retrieval.
 *
 * What actually makes them interesting is narrower and purely structural:
 * they produce 384 at full published quality, so IF the gold set says they
 * match gemma@512, the fix costs NO wide-column migration.
 *   - 97m is natively 384 — no truncation happens at all.
 *   - 311m publishes 384 as a trained nesting point, so its 384 is a
 *     first-class output rather than a prefix taken on faith.
 * Both are claims about what the width COSTS to adopt. Whether either is any
 * GOOD at 384 is decided by the gold set (P-003), never by this docblock.
 *
 * SPACE: granite vectors are a DISTINCT embedding space from gemma/BGE/OpenAI
 * (the embedding-space-vs-dimension scar / EI-8913) — same 384 dims,
 * incomparable cosine. Adoption means a full re-embed, never a mixed table.
