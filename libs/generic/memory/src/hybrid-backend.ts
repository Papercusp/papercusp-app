/**
 * HybridBackend (memory-backend-improve-and-hybrid P-020).
 *
 * Fuses a LEXICAL leg (exact-identifier — the claude-file token search) and a
 * COSINE leg (semantic/paraphrase — the mem0/canonical pgvector store) so one
 * backend captures BOTH columns the bench showed are complementary
 * (claude-file exact-id MRR 0.99 + mem0 paraphrase 5/6) instead of a lossy
 * either/or (D-001).
 *
 * - READS fuse via reciprocal-rank fusion (see hybrid-fusion). DEFAULT mode is
 *   `floored-union`: the result is the FP-floored cosine hits (SearchOptions.minScore)
 *   UNION the lexical hits that clear the identifier-precision bar (minLexScore) —
 *   so an exact-id target the cosine leg missed is still captured (the lexical leg
 *   is a co-equal recall source, not just a re-ranker), while a hard-negative floors
 *   away in cosine AND fails the lexical bar → empty. `cosine-gated` mode (lexical
 *   re-ranks only, never admits) stays selectable for the strictest discipline.
 * - WRITES (remember/forget/update/list/get) delegate to the COSINE backend —
 *   the canonical PG store — so the hybrid is cross-backend BY CONSTRUCTION: any
 *   client's `memory:*` call (claude/omp/codex all hit the same operator) lands
 *   in the one shared store, and a remember from any client is recallable from
 *   all three (D-002). The lexical leg searches the same memories once they are
 *   projected into its native form (the claude topic files). In the bench both
 *   legs are seeded identically, so fusion is exercised directly; in production
 *   that native-surface projection of the canonical store into each client's
 *   auto-inject surface rides the owner-deferred mem0 revive (P-022 /
 *   docs-and-memory-as-projections D-008) — until then the lexical leg only
 *   re-ranks what is already in the native store and the cosine gate carries
 *   recall, so the hybrid degrades cleanly to cosine-only for un-projected writes.
 * - `available()` tracks the cosine leg (the source of truth + write target); a
 *   missing/cold lexical leg just degrades search to cosine-only.
 * - The legs may be asked DIFFERENT questions: `SearchOptions.lexicalQuery`
 *   overrides the text the lexical leg searches while the cosine leg keeps
 *   `query` (context-injection-audit-2026-07-28 P-044). Omit it and both legs
 *   get `query`, exactly as before. Read that option's doc before using it —
 *   the lexical score is normalized by query-token count, so a longer lexical
 *   query lowers every hit's score against `minLexScore`.

   * reclaims the budget. The QUALITY invariant still holds exactly: every
   * candidate here already cleared its leg's admission bar (the cosine floor /
   * `minLexScore`), so diversity re-ranks the admitted set and can never
   * re-admit a floored-out hit.
   *
   * Bounded to a `limit`-relative head for cost: MMR is O(n²) in pairwise
   * similarity and this runs on the per-turn injection critical path inside a
   * timeout. Anything below `RERANK_DEPTH_FACTOR × limit` cannot reach the
   * final top-K by diversity alone, so re-ranking the deep tail buys nothing and
   * costs quadratically. The tail is preserved in relevance order behind the
   * head, so an unlimited caller still gets every entry back.
