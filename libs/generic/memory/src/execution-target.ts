/**
 * execution-target.ts — what device the EMBEDDERS are actually running on.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `@papercusp/rerank` has reported `activeExecutionTarget()` /
 * `rerankExecutionHealth()` on the sidecar's `/healthz` since plan D-006, so a
 * reranker silently demoted from GPU to CPU is visible without anyone opening a
 * process. The embedders had no equivalent, and the cost of that asymmetry is
 * measured, not hypothetical: between 2026-08-27 and 2026-09-06, FOURTEEN
 * separate work-items were filed against embed latency (query embeds blowing the
 * 4000ms `WORK_ITEM_EMBED_TIMEOUT_MS` budget, taking semantic recall and
 * work-item dedup down fleet-wide with them). Every one of those filings looked
 * at the request path — the sidecar's bounded-concurrency scheduler, its FIFO
 * queue, the client-side query-embed cache — because the request path is the
 * only thing `/healthz` could describe.
 *
 * A 14-probe discriminant on 2026-09-06 refuted all three of those mechanisms at
 * once: embed latency does NOT track queue depth (12 of 14 probes dispatched at
 * depth 0, and the three WORST results — 8521, 8016 and 6590 ms — all landed
 * there, while a *saturated* sample returned in 1543ms). The real mechanism was
 * never in the scheduler. It is that a single forward pass on this host costs
 * ~1.5-2.5s median with a tail past 8.5s, because the embedders run on the CPU:
 * no embedder requests a device, so `pipeline()` takes onnxruntime's CPU default.
 *
 * ## ⚠ `bundled` DOES NOT MEAN AVAILABLE — read this before adding a field
 *
 * The first version of this module (2026-09-07, same day) reported a
 * `gpuBundled` boolean derived from `onnxruntime-node`'s
 * `listSupportedBackends()`, and documented it as "a GPU-capable execution
 * provider is compiled into this build". **That was wrong, and it was wrong in
 * the dangerous direction: it under-reports.** Measured the same day:
 *
 *   - A default `npm install onnxruntime-node@1.24.3` yields
 *     `[{cpu,bundled:true},{webgpu,bundled:true},{cuda,bundled:false},…]`.
 *   - Re-installing the SAME version with `ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=v12`
 *     downloads `libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so` (~315MB) — and
 *     `listSupportedBackends()` STILL reports `cuda: bundled:false`.
 *   - Yet in that tree `InferenceSession.create(model, { executionProviders:
 *     ['cuda'] })` **constructs successfully**, emitting genuine
 *     `CUDAExecutionProvider` graph-partition logs.
 *   - The `onnxruntime_binding.node` addon is byte-identical (384040 bytes) in
 *     both trees. Only the provider `.so` files differ.
 *
 * So `bundled` is **publish-time packaging metadata** — "does this provider ship
 * in the default npm tarball" — and it is NOT a capability probe. A host can run
 * CUDA perfectly while `bundled:false`. Reporting it as availability would have
 * told the next reader "no GPU here" on a working GPU box, which is exactly the
 * class of confidently-wrong detector this module exists to replace.
 *
 * What this module reports instead:
 *
 *   1. **What the embed path requests.** Until 2026-09-24 that was NO device —
 *      the root cause above. Since then `embed-device.ts` chooses one
 *      (`PAPERCUSP_EMBED_DEVICE` auto|gpu|cpu, plan memory-reduction-2026-09-24
 *      D-003) and every embedder constructs through it; `execution-target.test.ts`
 *      PINS that against the embedder sources, the worker script included.
 *   2. **What actually constructed.** `active` / `pipelines` / `demotion` come
 *      from real session construction (a GPU that will not build falls back to
 *      the CPU with its cause recorded). Before any pipeline exists, `active`
 *      carries `verified: false` — the device the next one will TRY.
 *   3. **Which provider libraries are present on disk.** The availability
 *      signal (`providerLibraries` / `gpuProviderAvailable`).
 *   4. **What ships by default.** `defaultBundledBackends`, kept because it
 *      explains WHY a provider is absent (nobody passed the install flag), but
 *      explicitly named so it can never again be read as availability.
 *
 * An unresolved probe reports `null` everywhere — never a convenient `false`.
 * UNKNOWN is in-band and asserted by test.
 *
 * This module reports; `embed-device.ts` chooses.
