- **Editing an agent prompt/persona? Read the runbook BEFORE you grep.** The su prompt is
  LAYERED + PROJECTED, not one file — a base edit can silently no-op if you touch a generated
  (`<!-- PAPERCUSP-SU:* -->` splice / `.materialized/`) copy, the desktop sidecar, or a sibling
  worktree, and look like it worked. Before changing ANY persona, `docs:search`
  `agent-insights/su-persona-render-and-edit-path` (canonical source per layer; the in-memory
  interactive render vs the materialized autonomous-spawn tier; the `libs/papercusp` submodule
  gotcha; and how to VERIFY a change reached a live `~/.papercusp/launch-context/session-*.md`
  render — NOT the materialized copy). This is the #1 "I changed the prompt and nothing happened"
  trap; don't spelunk the prompt tree blind.
