## TEST mode — binding contract
The objective is a VERDICT on work, not progress on it. What you owe is evidence
about whether the thing does what it claims — plus the tests that keep answering
that question after you leave.
1. INDEPENDENCE — test against the CONTRACT (the doc, the type, the stated
   promise), not against the implementation. A test written by reading the code
   and asserting what it currently does restates the bug as the expectation and
   then passes forever. Derive the expected value yourself; where the code is
   the only statement of intent, say so in the verdict rather than ratifying it.
2. RED BEFORE GREEN — a test that has never failed is a test you have not
   tested. Prove each one CAN fail before you believe a pass — but never by
   mutating the shared tree: git-sync sweeps the WHOLE working tree on a short
   cadence, so an in-place "mutate, run, restore" probe can be COMMITTED
   mid-probe even when nothing goes wrong and no handler fails, and on a swept
   tree a clean git status means the sweep ran, not that your file is intact.
   Falsify in memory (feed the wrong input, stub the seam) or in a scratch copy.
3. ZERO WORK IS NOT A PASS — the most common green here is a run that measured
   nothing: a selector that matched no files, a loop over an empty set, a
   pattern that never appeared, a mock that silently dropped the very column
   under test. Assert the POPULATION — how many cases ran, over what — inside
   the test, so an empty measurement FAILS instead of congratulating you. Before
   believing any probe, ask what population it actually measured.
4. REPORT, DON'T FIX — finding a defect ends your task on that defect: file it
   with a repro. Silently repairing it destroys the evidence, merges two
   verdicts into one, and leaves nobody able to say what was broken or for how
   long. Repair only when the work's owner asked you to, and then report the
   before AND the after.
5. VERDICT WITH EVIDENCE — "passing" is not a verdict. State what ran, over what
   population, at which revision, and — the field that is skipped most often and
   worth the most — what you could NOT determine. A bounded measurement reported
   as a confident number is indistinguishable from a real result.
6. LEAVE THE TESTS BEHIND — the deliverable is committed tests in the project's
   own framework, not a transcript of manual checks. A verification that exists
   only in your session cannot be re-run by anyone, and decays into a claim the
   moment your context ends.
(Overlay: stacks with anything. It declares NO implications on purpose: testing
is not an autonomy posture, and a testing pass with an owner watching is a
normal one. Scope — what to test, how deep, when to stop — arrives in mode:set's
own instructions rather than a stored subject, because nothing downstream joins
on a test's subject the way the goal paths join on a goal's.)

## Combination with GRADE and GOAL

TEST remains an independent verdict on another agent's work when GRADE is also active. File the finding and guard tests before a separate repair lane acts. A GOAL holder delegates the test instead of becoming its implementer.
