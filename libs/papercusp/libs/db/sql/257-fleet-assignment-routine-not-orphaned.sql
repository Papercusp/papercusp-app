-- Migration 257 — EI-395: routine-held claims are NOT orphaned.
--
-- `fleet:assignments` (and the bulk orphan-reclaim sweep that reads it) flagged
-- claims held by the `improvement-runner` routine as orphaned/dead-holder, and
-- nearly bulk-swept the live (paused) improvement-implement lane. Root cause:
-- the orphaned signal is `live lease AND NOT holder_alive`, where holder_alive
-- requires a fresh coord_presence heartbeat OR a RUNNING spawned_agents row
-- (EI-311). A background ROUTINE is neither — it parks claims via
-- work_items.taken_by='improvement-runner' (and the lane is intentionally
-- paused), never writes presence, and is not a nursery spawn. So every routine
-- claim read holder_alive=false → orphaned=true → reclaim-eligible. Those claims
-- are NOT abandoned agent work; they are the routine's own parked lane.
--
-- Fix: a routine principal is never orphaned. The only principal that parks
-- claims this way today is 'improvement-runner' (the improvement-implement
-- lane). It's excluded by name on BOTH orphaned legs. Work-item claims carry no
-- per-claim liveness_mode in this view, so the exclusion is by holder name; if a
-- second routine starts parking claims, add it to the set here (or, the cleaner
-- generalization: give routine-parked claims a liveness_mode='routine' the view
-- can read — tracked as a follow-up, EI-395 thread).
--
-- This is the live-DB fix: migration 225 was edited in place to add this clause
-- (2026-06-13 02:20) but 225 was applied days earlier, so the edit was inert on
-- existing DBs. 225 has been reverted to its EI-311 form; this migration is the
-- single, properly-recorded owner of the current view definition. Re-creates the
-- 225 body verbatim, changing only the two orphaned expressions.
-- Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW.
