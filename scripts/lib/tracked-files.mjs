/**
 * tracked-files.mjs — the one tree enumerator every scripts/check-*.mjs guard
 * should use (WI-6730).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL: guards enumerated the tree with a bare
 * `git ls-files`, which does NOT recurse into submodules — it emits ONE gitlink
 * entry per submodule, not its contents. This repo has 39 submodules, including
 * libs/generic/sync (the sync transport + concurrency gate), libs/generic/sse,
 * libs/papercusp (harness / orchestrator / locks) and papercusp-desktop. So 26 of
 * 48 guards printed a confident ✓ for ~39 subtrees they had never opened.
 *
 * That failure mode is worse than a crash: a false ✓ actively suppresses the
 * question. `lint:no-raw-setinterval` — whose BASELINE is documented "MUST stay
 * empty ... that is the whole universal-visibility ratchet" — reported clean while
 * an unlisted host timer sat in libs/papercusp/packages/locks.
 *
 * WHY YOU CANNOT JUST EYEBALL THE PATH: `libs/generic/*` is MIXED. Some entries
 * are ordinary directories in the superproject (libs/generic/activity-bridge — IS
 * listed by plain `git ls-files`) and some are submodules (libs/generic/sync — is
 * NOT). Nothing about the path distinguishes them, which is why the blind spot
 * survived undetected.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `unscanned` IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, NOT AN ERROR CHANNEL.
 *
 * A submodule that is declared in .gitmodules but not initialized/checked out
 * contributes no files, and there is no honest way to assert anything about its
 * contents. Callers MUST NOT silently treat that as clean — that is the exact bug
 * above, one level up. Report it (see `describeUnscanned`) so a guard's output
 * says "checked N subtrees, could not check M" instead of a bare ✓.
 *
 * Today that set is normally just libs/zero-harness, which is retired and
 * deliberately not initialized — a legitimate skip, but still a stated one.

 * ── WHY THIS CANNOT JUST BE `listTrackedFiles` (WI-6730) ────────────────────
 * The identity guards (check-no-owner-name-tags, check-no-box-identity,
 * check-no-identity-literals) deliberately pass `--others --exclude-standard`,
 * because a brand-NEW file is invisible to a plain `git ls-files` until it is
 * `git add`-ed — and that is precisely the moment a fresh identity leak is most
 * likely to be sitting in the tree. Losing that would be a real regression, not
 * a stylistic one.
 *
 * But git REFUSES to combine those flags with recursion:
 *
 *     $ git ls-files --recurse-submodules --others
 *     fatal: ls-files --recurse-submodules unsupported mode
 *
 * So these guards could not adopt `listTrackedFiles()` without trading their
 * untracked coverage for submodule coverage — one blind spot for another. This
 * function buys both: the superproject keeps the untracked-inclusive flags, and
 * each submodule is enumerated with the SAME flags in its own working tree, with
 * results prefixed back to superproject-relative paths.
 *
 * A submodule git cannot descend into (no `.git` — the archive-extracted release
 * checkouts described under `describeUnscanned`) simply contributes nothing and
 * falls out as `unscanned`, exactly like the recursing path. Coverage is computed
 * from the emitted paths, never from an exit code, so the two agree.

 * That wasted-diagnostic-time cost is what EI-19301033966613245 was filed about.
 *
 * THE SHAPES THIS REPO ACTUALLY HAS (all measured 2026-08-02, and note that the
 * relevant `.git` is the SUBMODULE's — every one of these trees is itself a
 * linked worktree, so the superproject `.git` is a file in all of them):
 *
 *   papercusp (staging)      38/39 enumerated. The one gap, libs/zero-harness,
 *                            is retired and deliberately not checked out.
 *   papercusp-release,       0/39 enumerated, yet 38 hold content ON DISK.
 *   papercup-release         Submodule SOURCE is `git archive`-extracted by
 *                            setup-release-checkout.sh (deliberate — many pins
 *                            are never pushed to origin), and an archive
 *                            extraction cannot produce a `.git`, so
 *                            --recurse-submodules has nothing to descend into.
 *                            Stable across repeated measurement.
 *   papercusp-checkpoint     ⚠ VARIES. The GREEN GATE's own tree read 0/39 at
 *                            02:05Z and 38/39 at 02:21Z, after a 02:17Z rebuild
 *                            registered its submodules.
 *
 * That last row is the reason this function exists rather than a one-off fix.
 * The gate's tree is not reliably either shape, so NO caller may assume one —
 * and a guard's own output is the only surviving record of which shape it in
 * fact ran against. Do not "simplify" this by hard-coding an expectation, and
 * do not assert `.git` presence as a precondition: it is legitimately absent in
 * the release checkouts, where a precondition demanding it would fail forever.
 *
 * The suffix therefore names the shape it actually found:
 *
 *   present-on-disk-but-not-enumerable → archive-extracted / worktree (BY DESIGN)
 *   absent-from-disk                   → genuinely not initialized
 *
 * Reporting the RATIO is the load-bearing part: `0/39` cannot be misread as
 * clean, whereas a bare ✓ over an empty scan reads exactly like a pass.
